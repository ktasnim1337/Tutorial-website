			<p class="mytext">Hello, I'm Kazi and I go to Bayside High School. I am a sophomore. I have a younger sister. This is my first time making a website and it was very fun. 
                However, it did take a very long time to do and it was very hard. Our project is about living a healthy lifestyle. 
                Eating healthy, exercising, avoiding bad habits that can have negative impacts on our body and diets you can incorporate into your diet. In this project, we provided you with ways you can start living a healthy life.  </p>

				<p class = "mytext">Sophmore of Bayside Highschool, my CTE is Computer Program and Web Design. I stay healthy by eating multiple ranges of fruits and vegetables each day. 
                    I think being healthy is extremely important because nothing is more important than staying alive. Even when I have tons of homework to do, 
                    I always manage to consume an apple and bananas throughout the day. I never skip breakfast not only is it the most important meal of the day, but I'm also hungry in the morning. 
                    I always get breakfast at school which is cereal, milk, egg, waffles, and sometimes muffin containing high amounts of protein. 
                    Instead of drinking coffee a better preference is by sleeping early and waking up early and drinking milk in the morning. </p> <!--write about yourself, make it short-->
